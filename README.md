## Supplementary files 

This folder contains
  - Our implemented scuttlebutt attack
  - Our patched version of Tamarin
  - Our collection of models

Scuttlebutt contains its own README discussing how to reproduce the attack.

Our version of Tamarin can be built with the standard toolchain. The manual, help and support can be found the Tamarin [website](https://tamarin-prover.github.io/).

Each model contains a comment with the results and running time. No model required any non-default heuristics. Running times were calculated on a 32 core server with 512GB of RAM.
